## Introduction

This guide is heavily focused on fiction reading and aimed at those with an interest in Chinese fiction and webnovels. If you are more interested in reading the news, business, scientific or other specific content then this may not be the right guide for you.

Chinese webnovels are different from fan fiction or self-published novels; in fact, they closely mirror their traditionally published fellows.

In order to cater for all learners, those following and not following a language learning programme, we’ve divided the sections in this guide by character count (not to be confused with words). The number of characters you know is not necessarily an accurate reflection of your reading level as grammar, writing style and sentence structure play a part in your ability to comprehend a piece of text. However, it is a decent enough indication for this guide.

If you are unsure how many characters you know, you can take a quick test over at [Hanzishan]() which will give you a rough estimate. If you are strictly following the HSK 2.0 or HSK 3.0 programme, reference the below table to see the cumulative number of words and characters you should know after passing each level:

![]()

This should be of help when referencing our reading-difficulty sections given below, as the HSK approximations given are only on the 2.0 framework.

❗ As a second language learner, reading should not be the sole study method, especially during the early stages of your Chinese studies. Reading should only be in addition to textbooks or other formal studies.

❗ As a heritage speaker, if you have some degree of Mandarin listening comprehension, combining listening with reading can be a great way to quickly boost your Chinese literacy at any stage of your journey. However, be mindful not to jump too far ahead as—depending on the novel—the language and vocabulary found in literature differ greatly from those used colloquially.

## Tools

### Pleco

Pleco is a free Chinese-English dictionary app available on Android and iOS. Additional add-ons can be purchased, which provide extra features such as a flashcard (SRS) system, a Chinese-to-Chinese dictionary, a document reader, additional native sound packs, OCR, and graded readers. Pleco is a must-have app for learners of all stages, and its Basic Bundle is a very worthwhile investment.

### An SRS app (Anki or Pleco)

Ideally, this app should utilise [spaced repetition](https://www.hackingchinese.com/an-introduction-to-spaced-repetition-software/), so that you only learn words when you’re on the verge of forgetting them.

Anki is a spaced repetition flashcard software, available on Mac OS, PC and mobile devices with cloud syncing. It’s customisable with plugins that offer extra features, such as dictionaries and audio. While free on Windows, MacOS, and Android phones, it is priced $25 for iPhone users.

Pleco, in addition to being a brilliant dictionary, also offers a $10 spaced repetition flashcard add-on. This has the added benefit of native audio and a dictionary right out of the box and is specifically catered to Chinese learners.

Regular review of vocabulary, pronunciation, and phrases using spaced repetition is highly recommended at all stages of your Chinese learning journey.

### A popup Chinese → English dictionary

There are browser extensions that enable you to hover over any Chinese word to see its pinyin and definition. Some additional features include audio, dictionary look-up, and add-to wordlist. We recommend [Yomitan](https://yomitan.wiki/) — try these three extensions and see which you prefer.

Available on Chrome and Firefox.

Must-have for all learners.

### Dictionary and Translation Tools

[Baidu Fanyi](https://fanyi.baidu.com/mtpe-individual/multimodal#/) and [Kagi Translate](https://translate.kagi.com/) are fantastic tools that are more than just translation. Both of these tools provide further explanation of each word (in Chinese and English) as well as example sentences. Further explanation of each word is also included for both English and Chinese. It is more accurate than Google Translate (for Chinese–English). Looking up example sentences is a great way to further deepen your understanding of a word or phrase.

### Readibu

[Readibu](https://www.readibu.com/) is an app that allows for easy immersion into the webnovel world. It puts the content of a webpage into a user-friendly reader mode, with a one-tap popup Chinese -> English dictionary and text-to-speech.

Readibu has popular webnovels already listed in the app, as well as the ability to create your own custom bookmarks of any webnovels, short stories or articles you find online.

The app is available for both iOS (phone only) and Android (phone only)

Suitable for HSK 4+ (1000 characters+) learners

## Below 1000 characters (HSK1 - HSK4)

In order to start reading content outside of your textbook or other formal study material, you’ll need to have at least a good understanding of basic sentence structures and grammar.

❗ As a second language learner, reading should not be the sole study method at this point.

❗ As a heritage speaker, if you are familiar with the fundamentals, are able to hold basic conversations, and find apps or textbooks for second language learners too elementary—it’s time to get your feet wet, starting with simple reading materials! We highly recommend Little Fox Chinese (see below for more details).

### Resources

[Little Fox Chinese](https://chinese.littlefox.com/en) (free when using the website, but requires a subscription to use on mobile). This is the best free resource available (at this level) for improving your literacy and listening skills.

All content is presented visually as stories narrated by natives but catered to learners. Optional subtitles can be toggled, along with a wordlist and a separate English transcript.

Little Fox currently has 5 levels, each with lessons ranging from a few words long (Level 1) to full-length short chapters (Level 5). Level 5 content contains approximately 2.5k unique characters. We strongly recommend working through to Level 5 and learning most of its vocabulary.

These levels do not follow a particular framework, such as the HSK, so please note that their videos may include some advanced/out-of-syllabus words.

[Mandarin Bean](https://mandarinbean.com/) (FREEMIUM) - excellent HSK 1-6 stories, with dozens under each HSK tag. Native audio for all stories is available, along with pinyin, traditional characters and a pop-up dictionary. Paid memberships grant access to additional features, including translation and the option to download the story.

[Chinese Reading Practice](http://chinesereadingpractice.com/) \- Good resources for shorter stories, and while only a few of the more difficult words in the story are explained further, there is still a full English translation for each text. HSK 1-6; unfortunately, it is no longer continued, so there are no new stories.

[HSK Reading](https://hskreading.com/) \- HSK 1-6 articles for reading, some with native audio. Note that the difficulty of an article can vary somewhat despite the tag.

[Chinese Graded Reader](https://chinesegradedreader.com/)\- A range of articles from HSK 1 to 3, complete with audio, translation, pinyin, and hover-over definitions. The creators have stated that vocabulary from higher HSK levels is strictly excluded.

[Yes! Chinese](http://www.yes-chinese.com/reading/view.do?id=20120306182054) \- this website sorts their short stories by HSK, but different authors will have very different ideas of what difficulty matches up with which HSK level (for example, some will use many idioms (成语 - chengyu) or high-level words, but grade it quite low - grading is all done subjectively by those who upload). We recommend that you find an author who writes at a level that is approachable to you.

### Tips

When reading content from outside your textbook (i.e. a graded reader, DuChinese) and you are frequently encountering the same unknown word, consider adding it to your flashcard deck even if it’s from a higher HSK level or not in the HSK programme. However, do not fall into the trap of adding every unknown word. Consider setting a daily limit and sticking to words that you see frequently.

*Not reading specific* - be clear with your goals. If you’d like to speak well, try to remember the tones of words when you learn them so that you can pronounce them accurately - or even practice reading aloud (or equally, “shadowing” - closely repeating the audio from a story, ideal with those that have native audio). But if you only want to read, this can be skipped, although it is not advised.

Don’t be afraid of diving into slightly more challenging content. Even if the reading is intensive (under 98% of words understood, but more than 90%, see Reading Tools, Tips, and FAQ), you will still gain something from the practice. At the end of this level, you could already dive into simple novels, such as the much-beloved 秃秃大王 by 张天翼.

Learn to read characters - pinyin will only get you so far. While many graded readers for beginners may provide pinyin on top, or apps support this, it’s a crutch rather than a tool. At later stages, there will be many words with the same pinyin, which will make reading harder if you don’t learn characters. Equally, the majority of native Chinese sites and resources won’t provide pinyin.

## 1000 - 2000 character count (HSK 4 - HSK 6)

With around 1000 characters under your belt, you can start to dive into simple native content for young children and some short adult webnovels.

“Children’s books are made for native children and therefore not suitable for second language learners.” As each individual has their own goals and reason for learning Chinese, this statement doesn’t apply to everyone. You are reading this guide because you want to eventually read native novels, therefore your needs and goals are very different from those learning Chinese for other reasons such as communication and business. Children’s books are written to entertain children but also to teach them words and improve their literacy skills. If it can improve theirs, it can improve yours.

💪 This is the most difficult stage of your literacy journey where most native adult content will feel inaccessible and difficult but we promise, it won’t last forever. You may have to power through content that isn’t particularly interesting to you in order to reach where you need to be, but it’s all worth it in the end. Don’t give up, 加油 you can do it!

The best website for reading short children’s stories

Their easiest category is [宝宝睡前故事](https://www.qigushi.com/baobao/), followed by [童话故事](https://www.qigushi.com/tonghuagushi/).

[Gushi365](https://www.gushi365.com/) \- a wonderful website for finding children’s short stories.

[Yes! Chinese](http://www.yes-chinese.com/reading/view.do?id=20120306182054) \- this website sorts their short stories by HSK, but different authors will have very different ideas of what constitutes an HSK level.

Webnovels and books for intermediate level

You can find a curated list of webnovels and books graded by difficulty, along with statistics, over at our website [Webnovels & Books (小说)](https://www.notion.so/Webnovels-Books-29ee006777bd4d9fbbd0ea5eb29ec514?pvs=25). We only recommend original native fiction because translated works tend to contain unusual sentence structure (known as translationese), and often the language is nothing like the original native work.

Not sure where to start? Why not start with the easiest native novel 秃秃大王 by 张天翼 or try one of the others listed below:

!!! The first few chapters will always be challenging but we promise, it will get easier! If it’s still too difficult after a few chapters, consider trying a different novel or completing the higher-level lessons on Little Fox Chinese or DuChinese before attempting again.

### Tips

Review new words regularly \- If you are not already noting down words to study and review regularly (recommended to use a spaced repetition system), this is the time to start. You will start to encounter unknown words and characters that aren’t among the 1000 most frequent characters, but they are frequent enough that they can be bothersome if you need to keep looking them up.

Don’t add every unknown word \- Don’t fall into the trap of adding every unknown word to your deck because it will grow faster than you can cope with. It’s best to set yourself a daily limit. We recommend beginners start with 5 or fewer per day, then slowly build up when you feel you can cope with more words. Little by little is far more effective than a large quantity at once. Most learners cap themselves at 20 new words per day.

You won’t miss out on words \- Don’t feel that you will miss out on any words, as they will make an appearance again and common words will reappear sooner than you expect. If you are adding words to your deck because you feel that you’re going to miss out on the said word, essentially that is saying to yourself “I’m never going to see this word again, I better add it now”, if that is the case, why are you learning this word in the first place?

Deciding on which words to review regularly \- Deciding on which words to add and which ones to leave out can be a difficult decision at this time. You can look up the frequency of a word/character from a frequency list or you can make a subjective judgment based on your own need. To help you make a better decision, here are some things to consider:

    - Have you seen or heard this word before? - if you feel that you’ve seen it before (maybe even many times) then it’s a good chance that it’s a common word

    - Is the word a verb or an adjective? - these types of words are more likely to appear again, especially words that describe an emotion or facial expression.

    - Is the word a noun? - some nouns are definitely more common than others, you can make a judgment here based on what the noun is, and how often you would use it in your own language. If it isn’t often then it’s likely not that common in Chinese either.

    - Is the word personally useful to you? - the usefulness and frequency of a word will massively depend on the type of books you read and your personal interest. For example, if you mostly enjoy content from the fantasy genre, then fantasy specific vocab will be more useful to you than crime vocab.

Read short novels \- During the early stages of reading native literature, you might find that completing shorter novels regularly will provide you with the satisfaction and motivation to keep going. It can also help to avoid any feeling of being overwhelmed by the sheer length of a novel or long chapters.

## 2000 - 3000 character count (Beyond HSK6)

Once you know around 2000 characters, you’ll be stepping into the late elementary to early middle school level, and some simple webnovels and books would also be manageable at this stage. This will open up a broader variety of content that you can consume.

If you are following the HSK programme, you’re likely at the end of your HSK studies.

![💪 Callout icon](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)

This is an awkward phase, where you know most of the words on a page, but still not enough to completely comprehend what is going on. Grammar and sentence structure will also start to get more advanced as you move into the more native grown-up territory. There will be many hurdles and many “I can read all the words, but I don’t understand the sentence”, but bear with it, and eventually you’ll break through!

![📚 Callout icon](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)

At this stage, you can use reading as your sole immersion material, but it’s always best to consume a broad range of content, especially if you enjoy other forms of Chinese entertainment.

### Tips

Review new words regularly \- If you don’t already have a study plan to learn and review new words, you really need to decide on a plan now. Learning infrequent words will be very difficult without regular review as you’re unlikely to encounter them often enough for you to be able to remember them easily. You don’t want to be relying on a dictionary forever!

Use new words actively \- Actively using new words is a great way to learn and remember them, especially for those not-so-common words. If you can’t use them in your day-to-day life, then writing sentences is a very good alternative. You can find example sentences on [Baidu Fanyi](https://fanyi.baidu.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1644156726543866&usg=AOvVaw27n35G7_HjN1IKReFCwPfu), as mentioned in the [tools](/b4d287ad630c439fb8978d33b06c1b00) section above, and use these to help you to write your own.

Consider choosing novels in the genres you enjoy \- This is now a great time to start driving into early middle school or even simple webnovels and books of your favourite genre. You want to start picking up genre-specific vocabulary to learn along with more generalised vocabulary.

It isn’t a waste of time to read easier content \- There are many words to be learnt and much experience to be gained from all types of reading material. Never be afraid to read content that’s tagged as easier than your current level. You will still learn new words and gain experience in a different writing style which will result in further improvement in your overall literacy skills.

## 3000+ characters

With 3000 characters, you’ll be able to read many books across various genres without the need to consult the dictionary much, especially modern (现代), slice of life (日常生活) or romance (言情) novels.

Certain novels that are heavy on themes like fantasy (奇幻), martial hero (武侠), immortal hero (仙侠), ancient (古代), politics (政治) and science fiction (科幻) may still require the regular use of a dictionary due to the specific words in their respective genre (i.e. magic system, world-building, archaic language, etc).

![💪 Callout icon](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)

Keep learning new words and characters, and eventually one day you can say goodbye to the dictionary.

### Tips

Read broadly \- If you’re not already doing so, be sure to read novels containing various different subject matters and by different authors. The more experience you gain from different writing styles, the quicker and easier it’ll be for you to adapt to a new book and style.

## General FAQ

### Difficulty Levels

### Which level is suitable for me?

We have divided our webnovels and books into six difficulty levels. These levels aren’t following any particular second-language programmes. We try our best to mark each piece of content as accurately as possible based on our own experience and comments from other readers. Unfortunately, it isn’t perfect and may slightly differ between genres. We suggest you try a few from the same level to determine if it is the right level for you.

Here’s a quick explanation to help you determine which one will be suitable for you.

![Callout icon](/icons/stairs_red.svg?mode=dark)

Newcomer \- I’ve been learning Chinese for a while and want to start reading native books

Intermediate -I’ve read a few native books and know ~1.2k characters

UpperIntermediate -I’ve been reading native books for a while and I feel I have a good grasp of basic grammar. I comfortably know ~1.8k characters

Experienced \- I’ve read many books by different authors and comfortably know ~2.5k characters. I feel I have a good grasp of the language and I'm becoming familiar with descriptive writing.

Mastery -I comfortably know ~3k characters and I’m becoming familiar with literary writing.

Ascended \- I’m interested in exploring some difficult and challenging literature. I am comfortable with literary writing.

### What’s the ideal difficulty for reading?

There are three commonly known reading levels: extensive reading, intensive reading and reading pain. The category of the content that you choose will greatly affect your reading speed and comprehension.

If you want some more easy reading for fun, where you’ll passively be picking up words, aim for content where you understand 98% or more of the words. This is called “extensive reading”, and due to the relative ease with which you can read it (but still presence of unknown words) it is the perfect “sweet spot”. Here, you’ll be reading at a fast pace, while still picking up new words, but without needing to focus as much.

However, even content that’s above 90% comprehension is good - or intensive reading. Intensive reading is more deliberate, with a focus on taking in new words - you’ll be reading more slowly with a focus on learning.

You should approach any content where you understand less than 90% of the words/characters with care. While it is true that the beginning few chapters of many webnovels will be at this “reading pain” level, as long as you quickly take in the new words and move to the higher levels, it will be fine. However, if you consistently stay in the “reading pain” area, this will likely demotivate you due to poor comprehension, and your time is better spent learning with easier passages.

But ultimately, it’s your choice. The above system is only for reference, and what works best for you may not be what works best for most.

Last words on judging content difficulty

The app [Readibu](https://www.readibu.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1643884657137414&usg=AOvVaw213pqQg4IWzJXs-Uc68F5t) (see above) provides breakdowns of HSK word percentages and total unique words (also available on [the server’s best reading sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTnqyjv--iUkCnD7BBCUpDjKCOgXgPPdUtP1hSk8RtzaDE8ciQfDQzmS6illkN2fNUqVsIFBI8t_LCq/pubhtml&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1643884657138580&usg=AOvVaw1TfteEuz4ZizBXq5OL9WAw)). Keep in mind that it’s likely you know words outside of HSK/from higher HSK levels if you’ve been reading for longer, so the number is skewed downwards. Unique character count and a few chapters read will be your best benchmark.

The (paid at $20) [Chinese Text Analyzer](https://www.chinesetextanalyser.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1643884657140016&usg=AOvVaw0K6wBS8h10PMJwuld4yazK) software can also help you in assessing the difficulty of content, and even generating study lists. You can input a Chinese text file, and it will compare it to your known vocabulary, output statistics, and allow for the creation of lists with unknown vocabulary. This can be a useful tool if you use it a lot in order to gain an idea of how hard a text is, and you can try its two-week free trial to see if it’s something you’d like to invest in.

Finally, while frequency lists (as an alternative to the HSK) can provide some measure of difficulty - for example, you’d assume that the more you know the more readable a more difficult novel would be. However, at higher levels (past the few hundred words/characters boundary), you’ll find that it’s increasingly less likely that the words you have learnt can be found in the novel. So, the number of custom words you’ve added, especially from other novels, will be a better measure.

### Learning Techniques

### How long will it take to learn enough words to be able to read novels without a dictionary?

Oh, the age-old question...unfortunately there isn’t a definitive answer to this question, it depends on each individual, their circumstances, and the type of novels they’re interested in. Undoubtedly, some genres (i.e. wuxia, xianxia) will require more words and characters than other genres (i.e. modern romance). Nevertheless, you should expect that it will take a few years before you can read some adult novels without a dictionary.

### Is following the HSK worthwhile?

Written with the HSK 2.0 in mind.

Unless you must complete the HSK tests to demonstrate your proficiency or for some other professional needs, we’d recommend stopping at around HSK 4 or 5. After HSK 4, the overlap between what you’ll see/read/hear and the HSK vocabulary grows increasingly smaller. The HSK word lists have been criticized as being too literary, and you’ll sound very formal reciting HSK 6 chengyu, etc. in most environments. Additionally, the syllabus is over a decade old, and often includes words that have fallen out of modern use.

That being said, following the HSK is better than doing nothing with your learning. There is certainly some overlap, and some learners might find the structured and detailed form of official textbooks very useful.

### Shall I wait till I’ve passed HSK 6 before reading?

Definitely not! There are many graded readers out there (already recommended in this document) and many good free resources, which will enable you to start reading from as early as HSK2. And at HSK 4 and 5, you can already start looking at some simpler novels.

### Should I first memorize the most common 3,000 characters before reading?

Often people say, by 3,000 characters you can read a large amount of content, so it will seem like a brilliant idea to memorise the most common 3,000 characters before diving into novels. However 3,000 characters = reading most content is not an exact science. Grammar and sentence structure are also important for comprehension and understanding.

It is far more important to learn words in context than just characters. Chinese words are often made up of 2 or more characters, and many characters have multiple meanings. There will be times when you can guess the meaning if you know all the characters of the word, but that will not always be the case. For example 把饺子放进开水里...开 = open 水 = water however 开水 doesn’t mean “open water”, it means boiling water.

Would you really be able to motivate yourself to do nothing but learn 3,000 characters for a few months? Without using these Chinese characters via reading/listening/writing/speaking, do you think you really can remember them all? If you were to learn 20 new characters every day (plus reviewing old ones regularly), it’ll take around 150 days/5 months to “learn” all 3,000. This is a long time to keep yourself motivated. It’s much more fun to learn Chinese words while consuming various content.

There are plenty of reading content that are suitable for beginners, so it is important to start reading as soon as you’re able to, and don’t leave it till you know enough characters.

### Is it better to pre-learn the new words before reading a chapter, or use a dictionary while reading?

There is no right or wrong, better or worse method. This all depends on personal preferences and what tools you have access to.

In order to pre-learn vocabs for a chapter, you would need to use a tool to actively keep a record of all the words you know and extract all the unknown words.

On the other hand, using tools like Readibu or Zhongwen browser plugins which provide a pop-up dictionary makes it quick and easy when reading digital copies. However, this isn’t available for physical books.

Consider trying out both methods (if you have the tools for it) and decide which is more suitable for you.

With that being said, we don’t pre-learn any new words before reading a chapter. While the argument for pre-learning is that it will make reading the actual chapter smoother, for us picking up words as we read works for the following reasons:

It’s less time-consuming as there’s no need to spend time analysing each chapter before diving into it.

No need to actively keep a record of all our known words as many are learnt naturally through exposure.

New words are encountered in context straight away.

Not every new word is useful to us at the time we encounter it, therefore we selectively pick words to add to our flashcard to learn and review; some words will be very specific and won’t be useful to us at all.

As we read only original native content, all these books are new to us. Nothing is worse than waiting 2-3 days to learn all the new words before diving into the next chapter of an intense plot twist!

### How often should I be reading?

If you’re reading this document, you’re likely learning Chinese for pleasure with the goal of reading webnovels, so you shouldn’t be too strict with yourself. It’s more important to keep up a steady habit instead of reading a lot and burning out, or even losing motivation.

That being said, as a general rule, try to read regularly. This will make it easier for you to remember words, as you’ll be seeing them at more frequent intervals - even if less often. It’s better to have shorter, more frequent sessions than longer, infrequent sessions. The amount of time you can spend reading will of course depend on your personal situation, but dedicating even a couple of hours a week will bring benefits.

If you’re struggling to find time to read, consider using “dead time” - waiting at the train station, on public transport, etc. With apps like [Readibu](https://www.readibu.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1644156726560114&usg=AOvVaw2GVZEbnyLdj_BNBS9lK_vK) and digital versions of Graded Readers available on Pleco, reading Chinese on the go couldn’t be any easier.

### Does pronunciation and tone matter for reading?

Technically speaking no because when you read in your head you can pronounce it however you like. Completely neglecting learning the proper pronunciation and tones and ignoring other language skills such as listening is generally not advised.

Although your immediate goal may be to read webnovels and you have no interest in other areas, it isn’t too wise to purposely put yourself in a situation where you can only read Chinese, but are unable to do anything else with it, as no one can predict the future. The day might come when you regret that decision and you don’t really want to start from zero all over again.

### Can I ignore listening, writing and speaking?

Generally speaking, when someone learns a language, they learn all four aspects of a language as they compliment each other. That isn’t to say that you have to work on other skills, however, they also play a part in improving your reading comprehension and literacy skills.

Listening by watching TV shows or listening to podcasts can help you deepen your understanding of a word or phrase as well as enable you to learn new ones. The more times you hear a word, the more likely you’ll remember it, and the deeper you’ll understand that word and how it can be used.

If you’d like to combine reading with listening, you can listen to audiobooks while reading - a number of sites and apps will provide audio narrations for more popular novels and children’s stories especially.

Speaking and writing are both active ways you put words you learn into good use. If you actively use a word, you’re more likely to remember it, of course, it will further deepen your understanding of that word. Writing characters by hand might seem mostly unnecessary nowadays, but it can help you retain characters more easily and you’ll be able to differentiate between similar-looking ones a lot better while reading them. If you have trouble with specific characters, consider writing them down by hand during your practice and taking a closer look at their radicals.

### How can I achieve high reading speeds?

Want a more in-depth answer? We wrote an entire article on this subject: [![](/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F9ac44769-4f67-4a8f-bbd8-71883e6cbfb7%2Ficons8-lightning-bolt-100.png?table=block&id=78257ff1-1d36-484d-933d-d126e198d676&spaceId=379ba8d6-cb6b-4978-b316-a4431103cf85&width=200&userId=&cache=v2)Improving your Reading Speed — Seven Strategies](https://heavenlypath.notion.site/Improving-your-Reading-Speed-Seven-Strategies-78257ff11d36484d933dd126e198d676?pvs=24).

It stands to reason that if you can improve your Chinese reading speed, you should do so - as long as your comprehension doesn’t take too much of a hit, a higher reading speed will mean that you’re learning and enjoying more content in the same time frame.

Native Chinese speakers typically have a reading speed that falls somewhere between 300 and 700cpm (characters per minute). You can find out your own current speed by counting up the characters in a piece of text (preferably at least a thousand characters long and extensive), and then timing yourself and finding the average.

If you’re anywhere below 200cpm, there’s still plenty of room for improvement, and even at higher levels, upping your speed is worthwhile. Our goal is 一目十行！

There are three primary methods to start reading faster. Firstly, and perhaps more obviously, work on your vocabulary. The more words and characters you know, the fewer pauses you’ll make when reading. Regardless of your speed, because of this continual stoppage, you should never be reading anything below 90% comprehension - 98% and up is best. So, by choosing a text that you’re very familiar with, and continually learning new words/characters from the context in it, you’ll gradually find yourself making fewer and fewer pauses - and thus reading more and more quickly and fluently!

Another good approach is to try and listen along to texts while reading. This technique is called Reading While Listening (RWL) and has brought marked improvements to listening and speaking ability. The logic behind this is that if you play the text at just a bit faster than your reading speed, you’ll be forced to speed up in order to keep up with the text. At first, this might be difficult, but there are plenty of ways to adjust the speed of the audio being played in-app, or you can choose another text. Just don’t slow it down too much, to the point that it becomes as comfortable as, or even slower than, reading normally.

Lastly, you can try to reduce ‘tone police’. Given the tonal nature of the Chinese language, language learners often become fixated on pronouncing the right tones - I often used to go back and repronounce a text in my head if I thought I missed a tone, or obsessively check the pop-up dictionary to ensure that I subvocalized it correctly. While this is beneficial for your learning, it has the opposite effect on reading speed - constantly going back, checking, and slowing down the little voice in your head so you pronounce perfectly takes a real toll on speed. As a matter of fact, many native speakers sometimes don’t even pronounce the characters in their head, and just view the words and then glean the meaning through their ideographic nature.

### Shall I read along with a translation in my native language?

We would advise you to use a translation only when you are really struggling to understand a piece of text. Even though there are instances of quality translations that stick close to the original meaning, it's still more advantageous to your learning to just read the original or choose a simpler story. The ultimate goal of language learning is to think and function in your target language, not use your native one/s as a crutch.

A better alternative to refering to a translation would be to clarify anything you don’t understand with other learners or Chinese natives on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/zY2Fdwgz2f). We have a dedicated channel for Chinese-related questions.

### Narrow or broad reading, which is better?

### I’m a heritage Mandarin speaker, but I can’t read well. What should I do?

There is no better time to start than right now. As a heritage speaker, you have the advantage of already knowing the pronunciation and meaning of many common day-to-day words. Learning the written form of those words will be much quicker.

To get started, decide on a piece of suitable reading material for your level, set up a method of reviewing words ( [spaced repetition recommended](/b4d287ad630c439fb8978d33b06c1b00#42a36912d5fd4655b877edb35b34733d)), and start reading, reviewing, and learning new words on a regular basis. Combining listening with reading can also be a great way to quickly boost your reading ability.

If you are unsure of your level, try out the different resources recommended in [our reading guide](/b3d6abd583a944a397b4fbbb81e0c38c) and see what is right for you.
